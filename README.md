# Do It

Project for the Vue.js course @SoftUni

## Description

**Do It** is a web app that helps users organize their daily or long term tasks. Each user can log his tasks, mark the ones he has started working on as **In Progeress** and the ones he has finished as **Completed**. He can set a due date and due time, edit the content of each task or delete the ones he doesn't plan working on.
